# K-nearest-neighbour-model-for-digits

This project is helpful in implementing a K-Nearest Neighbor model that classifies digits using the scikit-learn digits dataset. This dataset consists of 8-by-8 pixel gray-scale images of hand-written digits from 0 through 9, and the goal will be to correctly identify the digit contained in each image.
